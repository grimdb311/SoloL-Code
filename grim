MINESWEEPER GAME 

I created this game to refresh my web skills and practice logical thinking. The design is simple and I only used alerts. I'm not sure if I was able to do the complete logic of the game. Please add a comment if you happen to find any logical errors.

v1.0.0 - started the main code logic. played the game a few times to get the gameplay...
v1.1.0 - completely dumped the contextmenu event for flagging coz of highlighting behavior on mobile. used a boolean variable instead.
v1.2.0 - added the styles.
v1.2.2 - made the td size fixed.
v1.2.3 - used media queries .... dumped media queries
v1.2.6 - added timer ... found a logical error in a certain case. maximum stack exceeded error in zeroMines function ...
v1.2.7 - fixed the error... incomplete logic:first click should never be a mine.
       - added the first click checker. First click is now safe.
       - added restart button as requested.
v2.0.0 - removed the table because of different css behaviors on some devices. used a div as container and pre for cells.

       TO DO: Optimize checkCoordinates function to return boolean and mine index
